# Course Project 
**Created by Selena Pol and Holli Meyers**, at the University of Washington. <br/>

## Overview
The repository contains a new, proposed portable information structure. We have presented the resulting structure as a product for Apple's IOS Weather app. With the plans of integrating the new structure into an already established system, we have extracted the existing information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and restructured it to contain the most relevant information for Apple and its users. <br/>

Within the repository are two folders labeled assignments and final-overview.
+ The assignments folder holds 8 prior course assignments (from G2-G9) that has helped shape this project.
+ The final-overview folder holds a presentation file and a code subfolder.

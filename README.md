# Course Project 
**Created by Selena Pol and Holli Meyers**, at the University of Washington. </br>

The repository contains a new, proposed portable information structure. We have presented the resulting structure as a product for Apple's IOS Weather app.


Create a new information ‘product’ by extracting, transforming and restructuring existing information into one appropriate for a new information story with a focus on Portability. Use Github for code and other artifacts.

This repository on portable information structures contains an 

code used to download and convert the structure and any code or processes for exposing the data as a website or API

application used to visualize an information system from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The application produces a dashboard to display real-time marine and coastal observations from buoy stations operated by NOAA, other government agencies, universities, and research institutions. These observations are compiled through NOAA's National Data Buoy Center.

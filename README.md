## Overview
The repository contains a new, proposed portable information structure. We have presented the resulting structure as a product for Apple's IOS Weather app. With the plans of integrating the new structure into an already established system, we have extrated the existing information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and restructured it to contain the most relevant information for Apple and its users.

Within the repository contains an Assignments and Deliverable folder.

application used to visualize an information system from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The application produces a dashboard to display real-time marine and coastal observations from buoy stations operated by NOAA, other government agencies, universities, and research institutions. These observations are compiled through NOAA's National Data Buoy Center.

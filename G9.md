# Test Plan for Ocean Data Intregration
The G9 markdown serves as a guide during implementation, and outlines the quality and performance of the ocean data that will be intregrated into a mobile weather application.

### Performance Goals
+ Real-time data refreshes.
+ Efficient data retrieval: deliver timely and accurate ocean information from data source.
+ Responsive/interactive UI.
  
### Quality Goals
+ User-friendly interface: features dynamic graphs.
+ Comprehensive ocean information: widget provides 10-day forecasts, severe weather alerts (tsunamis, coastal flooding, etc.), and detailed metrics like tide levels, wave height, and sea surface temperature. 

## Alarms
If data is flagged as incomplete or invalid (not meeting our performance/quality goals):
+ Program team will be notified
+ Program will fall under review
+ Program team will enact all tests detailed in document
+ All tests must be met before re-publishing data

## Testing
### Performance
Performance testing ensures the ocean widget performs smoothly and efficiently under various conditions.
+ API response time: ocean data retrieval completes within 300ms under normal network conditions.

### Functional
Functional testing will be used to verify that all widget features work as intended across all supported devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch).
+ Location services: detects userâ€™s current location coordinates accurately.
+ Forecast estimates: 10-day and hourly forecasts display accurate variables and values, and updates in real-time.
+ Severe alerts: show based on government source(s), and provides detailed information when opened.

### Quality
Quality testing validates the user experience, accessibility, and UI consistency.
+ Voice over support: all information is announced correctly.
+ User journey: adding a city, checking the forecast, and viewing a radar should be intuitive. This can be measured with session analytics.

# Test Plan for Ocean Data Intregration
The G9 markdown serves as a guide during implementation, and outlines the quality and performance of the ocean data that will be intregrated into a mobile weather application.

### Performance Goals
+ Real-time data refreshes.
+ Efficient data retrieval: deliver timely and accurate ocean information from data source.
+ Responsive/interactive UI.
  
### Quality Goals
+ User-friendly interface: features dynamic graphs.
+ Comprehensive ocean information: app provides 10-day forecasts, severe weather alerts (tsunamis, coastal flooding, etc.), and detailed metrics like tide levels, wave height, and sea surface temperature.

### Functional
Functional testing will be used to verify that all features work as intended across all supported devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch).
+ Location services: detects userâ€™s current location coordinates accurately.
+ Forecast estimates: 10-day and hourly forecasts display accurate variables and values, and updates in real-time.
+ Severe alerts: show based on government source(s), and provides detailed information when opened.

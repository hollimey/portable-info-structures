## About
The information structure provides values for tidal levels above average sea level. Users can quickly view the tidal levels at the sea nearest to them. Any Apple Weather users will be able to see the widget displaying the data visually in a graph.

## Methodology
Datasets, for now, are manually downloaded per day from the NOAA's water station webpages. The datasets are then uploaded into code for processing, cleaning, and visualization. As datasets get verified, the newly verified data will take priority over "preliminary" and "predicted" data. Our maintenance process will consist of re-uploading verified datasets after release, in case users wish to look at past data. We will also only be keeping 2 weeks and 1 day worth of data, for the current data and the week before and week after. This reduces storage needs and eases maintenance needs. 

## Access
1. Apple user opens their apple product software.
2. User navigates to the Apple Weather app.
3. User navigates to the widget focused on real-time ocean information.

## Structure
There are 5 columns in the information structure. "Date" represents the calendar date of the water station in it's respective local time, as datetime data type. "Time (GMT)" represents the time the tidal level was collected, in hh:mm:ss format, as datetime data type. There is a "Predicted (ft)" column, "Preliminary (ft)" column, and "Verified (ft)" column, all of which display tidal level data in ft. Predicted represents the predicted levels, Preliminary represents the initial data collected, and Verified represents reviewed data.

## Example
Please see "CO-OPS_9444900_wl.csv" file for an example of the information structure.
